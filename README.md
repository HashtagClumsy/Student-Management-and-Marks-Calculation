### Student Data Management and Marks Calculation in Java

This collection of programs provides a comprehensive demonstration of managing student data and calculating marks using Java. Each program highlights different aspects of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and input handling, showcasing various techniques to achieve similar goals.

#### Program 1: Student Management with Methods  
**Description:**  
This program defines a `Student` class with methods to set student details, calculate total marks, and display student information. It uses setter methods to initialize student data and a separate method to compute the total marks. This approach emphasizes modularity and reusability of methods.

#### Program 2: Student Management with Constructor  
**Description:**  
This program defines a `StudentDetails` class with a constructor to set student details and calculate total marks. By using a constructor, the program initializes the student data and computes the total marks in a single step. This approach demonstrates the use of constructors for initialization and encapsulation.

#### Program 3: Student Marks Calculation  
**Description:**  
This program calculates and displays the total and average marks of a student based on user input. It uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user and performs arithmetic operations to compute the total and average marks. This approach focuses on basic input handling and arithmetic operations.

These programs collectively demonstrate various approaches to managing student data and calculating marks in Java. The first two programs use classes and methods to encapsulate student details and calculate total marks, with the second program utilizing constructors for initialization. The third program focuses on calculating and displaying student marks using user input. Each program highlights different aspects of object-oriented programming and input handling in Java, providing a comprehensive overview of managing student data and performing arithmetic operations.
